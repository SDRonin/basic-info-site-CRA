# Basic Information Site CRA

## By Vincent Bradbury

This project deploys a basic information site that uses React's 'Create a React App' tooling.

Note that this project uses React version 18.2.0.  Therefore is uses the new ways to import images and CSS, and render components.

The content and CSS styling was made by reproducing a wireframe produced by Bob Ziroll.
